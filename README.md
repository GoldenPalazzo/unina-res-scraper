# unina-res-scraper

`unina-res-scraper` is an independent project mantained by me, in no way
affiliated with UniNa.

It serves as a command-line interface for the website `docenti.unina.it`,
providing:

- credentials storing
- automatic file download
- interactive courses browsing
- auto login

The interface is pretty intuitive. Any feedback is appreciated.

Required libraries in `requirements.txt`.
